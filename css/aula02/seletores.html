    <h1 class="center large">Hotel California</h1>
    <div>
        <p>On a dark desert highway</p>
        <p id="para1">Cool wind in my hair</p>
        <p>Warm smell of colitas</p>
        <p>Rising up through the air</p>
        <p>Up ahead in the distance</p>
        <p>I saw a shimmering light</p>
        <p>Head grew heavy and my sight grew dim</p>
        <p>I had to stop for the night</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>There she stood in the doorway</p>
        <p>I heard the mission bell</p>
        <p>And I was thinking to myself</p>
        <p>"This could be heaven or this could be hell"</p>
        <p>Then she lit up a candle</p>
        <p>She showed me the way</p>
        <p>There were voices down the corridor</p>
        <p>Thought I heard them say</p>
    </div>
    <p>Welcome to the Hotel California</p>
    <p>Such a lovely place (such a lovely place), such a lovely face</p>
    <p>There's plenty of room at the Hotel California</p>
    <p>Any time of year (any time of year), oh, you can find it here</p>
